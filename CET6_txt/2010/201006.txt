Obama's success isn't all good news for black Americans
    As Erin White watched the election results head towards victory for Barack Obama, she felt a burden lifting from her shoulders. "In that one second, it was a validation for my whole race," she recalls.
    "I've always been an achiever," says White, who is studying for an MBA at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. "But there had always been these things in the back of my mind questioning whether I really can be who I want. It was like a shadow, following me around saying you can only go so far. Now it's like a barrier has been let down."
    White's experience is what many psychologists had expected - that Obama would prove to be a powerful role model for African Americans. Some hoped his rise to prominence would have a big impact on white Americans, too, challenging those who still harbour racist sentiments. "The traits that characterise him are very contradictory to the racial stereotypes that black people are aggressive and uneducated," says Ashby Plant of Florida State University. "He's very intelligent and eloquent."
Sting in the tail
    Ashby Plant is one of a number of psychologists who seized on Obama's candidacy to test hypotheses about the power of role models. Their work is already starting to reveal how the "Obama effect" is changing people's views and behaviour. Perhaps surprisingly, it is not all good news: there is a sting in the tail of the Obama effect.
    But first the good news. Barack Obama really is a positive role model for African Americans, and he was making an impact even before he got to the White House. Indeed, the Obama effect can be surprisingly immediate and powerful, as Ray Friedman of Vanderbilt University and his colleagues discovered.
    They tested four separate groups at four key stages of Obama's presidential campaign. Each group consisted of around 120 adults of similar age and education, and the test assessed their language skills. At two of these stages, when Obama's success was less than certain, the tests showed a clear difference between the scores of the white and black participants—an average of 12.1 out of 20, compared to 8.8, for example. When the Obama fever was at its height, however, the black participants performed much better. Those who had watched Obama's acceptance speech as the Democrats' presidential candidate performed just as well, on average, as the white subjects.After his election victory, this was true of all the black participants.
Dramatic shift
    What can explain this dramatic shift? At the start of the test, the participants had to declare their race and were told their results would be used to assess their strengths and weaknesses. This should have primed the subjects with "stereotype threat" – an anxiety that their results will confirm negative stereotypes, which has been shown to damage the performance of African Americans.
    Obama's successes seemed to act as a shield against this. "We suspect they felt inspired and energised by his victory, so the stereotype threat wouldn't prove a distraction," says Friedman.
Lingering racism
    If the Obama effect is positive for African Americans, how is it affecting their white compatriots (同胞)? Is the experience of having a charismatic (有魅力的) black president modifying lingering racist attitudes? There is no easy way to measure racism directly; instead psychologists assess what is known as "implicit bias", using a computer-based test that measures how quickly people associate positive and negative words—such as "love" or "evil"—with photos of black or white faces. A similar test can also measure how quickly subjects associate stereotypical traits—such as athletic skills or mental ability—with a particular group.
    In a study that will appear in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Plant's team tested 229 students during the height of the Obama fever. They found that implicit bias has fallen by as much as 90% compared with the level found in a similar study in 2006. "That's an unusually large drop," Plant says.
    While the team can't be sure their results are due solely to Obama, they also showed that those with the lowest bias were likely to subconsciously associate black skin colour with political words such as "government" or "president". This suggests that Obama was strongly on their mind, says Plant.
Drop in bias
    Brian Nosek of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, who runs a website that measures implicit bias using similar test, has also observed a small drop in bias in the 700,000 visitors to the site since January 2007, which might be explained by Obama's rise to popularity. However, his preliminary results suggest that change will be much slower coming than Plant's results suggest.
Talking honestly
    "People now have the opportunity of expressing support for Obama every day," says Daniel Effron at Stanford University in California. "Our research arouses the concern that people may now be more likely to raise negative views of African Americans." On the other hand, he says, it may just encourage people to talk more honestly about their feelings regarding race issues, which may not be such a bad thing.
    Another part of the study suggests far more is at stake than the mere expression of views. The Obama effect may have a negative side. Just one week after Obama was elected president, participants were less ready to support policies designed to address racial inequality than they had been two weeks before the election. Huge obstacles
    It could, of course, also be that Obama's success helps people to forget that a disproportionate number of black Americans still live in poverty and face huge obstacles when trying to overcome these circumstances. "Barack Obama's family is such a salient (出色的) image, we generalise it and fail to see the larger picture—that there's injustice in every aspect of American life," says Cheryl Kaiser of the University of Washington in Seattle. Those trying to address issues of racial inequality need to constantly remind people of the inequalities that still exist to counteract the Obama's effect, she says.
    Though Plant's findings were more positive, she too warns against thinking that racism and racial inequalities are no longer a problem. "The last thing I want is for people to think everything's solved."
    These findings do not only apply to Obama, or even just to race. They should hold for any role model in any country. "There's no reason we wouldn't have seen the same effect on our views of women if Hillary Clinton or Sarah Palin had been elected," says Effron. So the election of a female leader might have a downside for other women.
Beyond race
    We also don't yet know how long the Obama effect—both its good side and its bad—will last.Political sentiment is notoriously changeable: What if things begin to go wrong for Obama, and his popularity slumps?
    And what if Americans become so familiar with having Obama as their president that they stop considering his race altogether? "Over time he might become his own entity," says Plant. This might seem like the ultimate defeat for racism, but ignoring the race of certain select individuals—a phenomenon that psychologists call subtyping—also has an insidious (隐伏的) side. "We think it happens to help people preserve their beliefs, so they can still hold on to the previous stereotypes." That could turn out to be the cruellest of all the twists to the Obama effect.

Part IV 		Reading Comprehension (Reading in Depth)			 (25 minutes)
Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a short passage with 5 questions or incomplete statements. Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete the statements in the fewest possible words. Please write your answers on Answer Sheet 2.
Questions 47 to 51 are based on the following passage.
    Question: My ninth-grade art teacher doesn't give any grade above 94% because, she says, "There's always room for improvement." In previous years, I earned a 99% and a 100%. The 94 I received this term does not reflect the hard work that I put into this course. Because of her "improvement" theory, I got a lower grade than I deserve. Is her grading philosophy ethical (符合职业道德规范的)?
    Answer: Your teacher's grading system may be unwise, but it is not unethical. A teacher deserves wide latitude in selecting the method of grading that best promotes learning in her classroom; that is, after all, the prime function of grades. It is she who has the training and experience to make this decision. Assuming that your teacher is neither biased nor corrupt and that her system conforms to school rules, you can't fault her ethics.
    You can criticize her methodology. A 100 need not imply that there is no possibility of improvement, only that a student successfully completed the course work. A ninth grader could get a well-earned 100 in English class but still have a way to go before she writes as well as Jane Austen. What's more, grades are not only an educational device but are also part of a screening system to help assign kids to their next class or program. By capping her grades at 94 while most other teachers grade on a scale that tops out at 100, your teacher could jeopardize a student's chance of getting a scholarship or getting into a top college.
    What it is wrong to condemn her for is overlooking your hard work. You diligence is worthy of encouragement, but effort does not equal accomplishment. If scholars suddenly discovered that Rembrandt had dashed off "The Night Watch" in an afternoon, it would still be "The Night Watch."
    I could spend months sweating over my own "paintings", but I'd produce something you wouldn't want to hang in your living room. Or your garage.
    One feature of a good grading system is that those measured by it generally regard it as fair and reasonable—not the case here. Simmering (难以平息的) resentment is seldom an aid to education.And so your next step should be to discuss your concerns with your teacher or the principal.
注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。
47. The ninth-grader thought that his art teacher should have given him ______.
48. According to the answer, a teacher should have the freedom to ______ to encourage learning.
49. We learn from the answer that a student who gets a 100 should still work hard and keep ______.
50. The example of Rembrandt's painting suggests that a distinction should be made between ______.
51. The ninth-grader is advised to go to his teacher or the principal to ______.
Section B
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 51 to 56 are based on the following passage.
    Only two countries in the advanced world provide no guarantee for paid leave from work to care for a newborn child. Last spring one of the two, Australia, gave up the dubious distinction by establishing paid family leave starting in 2011. I wasn't surprised when this didn't make the news here in the United States—we're now the only wealthy country without such a policy.
    The United States does have one explicit family policy, the Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993. It entitles workers to as much as 12 weeks' unpaid leave for care of a newborn or dealing with a family medical problem. Despite the modesty of the benefit, the Chamber of Commerce and other business groups fought it bitterly, describing it as "government-run personnel management" and a "dangerous precedent". In fact, every step of the way, as (usually) Democratic leaders have tried to introduce work-family balance measures into the law, business groups have been strongly opposed.
    As Yale law professor Anne Alstott argues, justifying parental support depends on defining the family as a social good that, in some sense, society must pay for. In her book No Exit: What Parents Owe Their Children and What Society Owes Parents, she argues that parents are burdened in many ways in their lives: there is "no exit" when it comes to children. "Society expects—and needs—parents to provide their children with continuity of care, meaning the intensive, intimate care that human beings need to develop their intellectual, emotional and moral capabilities. And society expects—and needs—parents to persist in their roles for 18 years, or longer if needed."
    While most parents do this out of love, there are public penalties for not providing care. What parents do, in other words, is of deep concern to the state, for the obvious reason that caring for children is not only morally urgent but essential for the future of society. The state recognizes this in the large body of family laws that govern children' welfare, yet parents receive little help in meeting the life-changing obligations society imposes. To classify parenting as a personal choice for which there is no collective responsibility is not merely to ignore the social benefits of good parenting; really, it is to steal those benefits because they accrue (不断积累) to the whole of society as today's children become tomorrow's productive citizenry (公民). In fact, by some estimates, the value of parental investments in children, investments of time and money (including lost wages), is equal to 20-30% of gross domestic product. If these investments generate huge social benefits—as they clearly do—the benefits of providing more social support for the family should be that much clearer.

    B) The fail to provide enough support for parents
    C) They emphasize parents' legal responsibilities.
    D) They impose the care of children on parents.

Passage Two
Questions 57 to 62 are based on the following passage.
    A new study from the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) at Tufts University shows that today's youth vote in larger numbers than previous generations, and a 2008 study from the Center for American Progress adds that increasing numbers of young voters and activists support traditionally liberal causes. But there's no easy way to see what those figures mean in real life. During the presidential campaign, Barack Obama assembled a racially and ideologically diverse coalition with his message of hope and change; as the reality of life under a new administration settles in, some of those supporters might become disillusioned. As the nation moves further into the Obama presidency, will politically engaged young people continue to support the president and his agenda, or will they gradually drift away?
    The writers of Generation O (short for Obama), a new Newsweek blog that seeks to chronicle the lives of a group of young Obama supporters, want to answer that question. For the next three months, Michelle Kremer and 11 other Obama supporters, ages 19 to 34, will blog about life across mainstream America, with one twist: by tying all of their ideas and experiences to the new president and his administration, the bloggers will try to start a conversation about what it means to be young and politically active in America today. Malena Amusa, a 24-year-old writer and dancer from St. Louis sees the project as a way to preserve history as it happens. Amusa, who is traveling to India this spring to finish a book, then to Senegal to teach English, has ongoing conversations with her friends about how the Obama presidency has changed their daily lives and hopes to put some of those ideas, along with her global perspective, into her posts. She's excited because, as she puts it, "I don't have to wait [until] 15 years from  now" to make sense of the world.
    Henry Flores, a political-science professor at St. Mary's University, credits this younger generation's political strength to their embrace of technology. "[The Internet] exposes them to more thinking," he says, "and groups that are like-minded in different parts of the country start to come together." That's exactly what the Generation O bloggers are hoping to do. The result could be a group of young people that, like their boomer (二战后生育高峰期出生的美国人) parents, grows up with a strong sense of purpose and sheds the image of apathy (冷漠) they've inherited from Generation X (60 年代后期和70 年代出生的美国人). It's no small challenge for a blog run by a group of ordinary—if ambitious—young people, but the members of Generation O are up to the task.

2010年6月大学英语六级(CET-6)参考答案
作文解析
此次作文考的是学生忽视汉语学习的现象及其原因、后果和对策分析。本次试题仍是延续以往的考试风格，关注与学生相关的学习、生活和社会问题，应该说这个题目从选题角度来看还是比较好把握的。
拿到题目时如何分析？看到这个题目，分析一下题目涉及到了哪些方面，而原因和对策必然是与这几方面相关的。题目是近年来在学生中出现了忽视中文学习的现象。学生问题一般很容易联想到社会、校方及自身。因此全文可做如下安排。
第一段总起全文，陈述这一现象的存在。由于国际交流的需要，如今语言学习的重心基本是外语学习，汉语学习却越来越不受重视了。
第二段进行原因和后果分析。我们可以从社会、校方及自身三方面进行论述。由于是社会问题，我们可以主要论述社会和校方两层原因。第一，整个社会重视外语多于汉语。在就业时，掌握至少一门外语比掌握汉语更有优势。后果是大多数学生都不再认可汉语学习的重要性了。第二，高校中也是重视外语教育，忽视汉语教育。有这两点原因就足够了。另外由于字数和时间限制，可以不必另起一段陈述后果，而将后果放在每条原因后面进行简要说明。
第三段进行对策分析。需要注意的是，这里的对策应与第二段提出的原因相对应。因此，第三段也应从社会和校方这两个角度进行论述。全社会应该重视起汉语学习，校方应推进汉语教育和研究。当然，我们也可以加上一点，即我们每个人都要去努力学习和保护汉语。
最后一段总结全文，既可以概述全文主题思想，也可以提出期望和要求。
总的来说，这篇文章不难写。需要大家注意的有三点：一是论述的条理性，二是总-分-总结构的运用，三是尽可能做到表达的多样化。
范文1
 Do you remember these famous litterateurs: Lu xun, Zhu zi qing, Laoshe or Bing xin? How familiar these names are! Unfortunately, countless students pay no attention to the study of Chinese. Nowadays, Internet, English and game occupy students’ time and attention. For the majority of students, the study of Chinese has become a remote memory.
    Why such a phenomenon emerges? Educators attribute it to the ignorance of university administration. Chinese is an essential course for college students in China. However, for a long time there has been a neglect in the study of Chinese. Taking a look around, every teacher encourages students to spend all time on learning English. On the contrary, none of them promotes students to learn Chinese. In the wake of this situation, students will make growing Chinese mistakes in spelling, reading and speaking. Maybe someday, Chinese would fade from historical stage.
    In my opinion, some drastic measures should be taken. First of all, we can raise students’ awareness that the study of Chinese is indispensable to us. In addition, teachers can offer more courses related to Chinese or Chinese culture. Finally, we can promote CCT(college Chinese testing) . In a word, due attention should be given to the study of Chinese。
范文2

    With China’s opening up, intercultural communication has become more and more frequent between Chinese and foreigners. A good command of at least one foreign language has increasingly been an essential skill for us. People, especially the youths, pay much more attention to foreign language acquisition than Chinese study.
    Various factors can account for this situation. First of all, a good command of a foreign language may help young people to get a good job while Chinese skills may be of no significance in one’s job hunting and even their career. Consequently, some students may not treasure Chinese language any longer. Apart from that, nowadays fewer and fewer universities stimulate Chinese language study in campus, which has caused it to be marginalized. Under this circumstance, Chinese language becomes less and less popular in universities. It is clear that professors in the field of Chinese study are not so respected than they were before.
    In view of this situation, effective measures should be taken to change it. First, the whole society should emphasize the importance of Chinese language in order to make it clear that it is one indispensable part of Chinese culture and Chinese race. Second, schools should promote Chinese language study and research. In addition, we individuals should contribute our own efforts to the study and protection of Chinese language.
    To conclude, we should pay great attention to Chinese language, since the importance of it is never too great to be exaggerated.



快速阅读解析
1. How did Erin White feel upon seeing Barack Obama’s victory in the election”?
A) Excited.
B) Victorious.
C) Anxious.
D) Relieved.
此题问的是Eric对于Obama选举胜利后感觉如何？
此题从文中第一段来找，As Erin White watched the election results head towards victory for Barack Obama, she felt a burden lifting from her shoulders. 关键字为a burden lifting from her shoulders（肩上放下了一个重担）与D选项relieved同义，故此题答案为D。

2. Before the election, Erin White has been haunted by the question of whether ________.
A) she could obtain her MBA degree
B) she could go as far as she wanted in life
C) she was overshadowed by her white peers
D) she was really an achiever as a student
此题问的是选举前Erin被什么问题所困扰？
此题从文中第二段找答案，But there had always been these things in the back of my mind questioning whether I really can be who I want.
关键字是whether，题目中有个whether,而此句中也有个whether.
题目中有个词haunted意思是：长期不断地缠扰（某人） ,缠绕, 萦绕
而此句in the back of my mind 与haunted同义，
所以要选择与I really can be who I want（我想成为我想成为的人）的意思相近，故选择B选项（在她的生活中，她想走多远，就能走多远，即她可以成为她想成为的人）。
3. What is the focus of Ashby Plant’s study?
A) Racist sentiments in America.
B) The power of role models.
C) Personality traits of successful blacks.
D) The dual character of African Americans.
此题问的是Plant的研究重点在于什么？
此题可以从文中找到答案:
Ashby Plant is one of a number of psychologists who seized on Obama’s candidacy to test hypotheses aboutthe power of role models. 
关键字为：the power of role models，与B选项对应，故此题答案为B。

4. In their experiments, Ray Friedman and his colleagues found that ________.
A) blacks and whites behaved differently during the election
B) whites’ attitude towards blacks has dramatically changed
C) Obama’s election has eliminated the prejudice against blacks
D) Obama’s success impacted blacks’ performance in language tests
此题问的是在试验中，Ray Friedman 和他的同事发现了什么？
此题也可以从文中找到相应的答案：When the Obama fever was at its height, however, the black participants performed much better. Those who had watched Obama’s acceptance speech as the Democrats’ presidential candidate performed just as well, on average, as the white subjects. 当奥巴马热达到最高潮时，那些黑人试验者表现就更好，这说明Obama的成功影响着黑人的表现，与D选项对应，故此题答案为D。
5. What do Brian Nosek’s preliminary results suggest?
A) The change in bias against blacks is slow in coming.
B) Bias against blacks has experienced an unusual drop.
C) Website visitor’s opinions are far from being reliable.
D) Obama’s popularity may decline as time passes by.
此题问的是Brian 的初步结果显示什么？
此题从文中可以找到答案:Drop in bias
Brian Nosek of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, who runs a website that measures implicit bias using silimar test, has also observed a small drop in bias in the 700,000 visitors to the site since January 2007, which might be explained by Obama’s rise to popularity. However, his preliminary results suggests that change will be much slower coming than Plant’s results suggest.
关键词为： change will be much slower coming ，而根据原文，change具体指a small drop in bias against blacks.
所以综合起来就是：对黑人歧视的人的数量将减少，这一改变将会慢慢到来，与A选项对应，故此题答案为A。

6. A negative side of the Obama effect is that ________.
A) more people have started to criticise President Obama’s racial policies
B) relations between whites and African Americans may become tense again
C) people are now less ready to support policies addressing racial inequality
D) white people are likely to become more critical of African Americans
此题问的是Obama effect所带来得消极影响是什么？
此题也可以从文中找到答案:
The Obama effect may have a negative side. Just one week after Obama was elected president, participants were less ready to support policies designed to address racial inequality than they had been two weeks before the election.
参与者在奥巴马当选后，支持解决种族不平等的政策的人变得少些了。与C选项对应，故此题答案为C。

7. Cheryl Kaiser holds that people should be constanly reminded that ________.
A) Obama’s success is sound proof of black’s potential
B) Obama is but a rare example of black’s excellence
C) racial inequality still persists in American society
D) blacks still face obstacles in political participation
此题问的是Cheryl Kaiser 认为人们应该不停地被提醒什么事情？
此题也可以从文中找到答案：
Those trying to address issues of racial inequality need to constantly remind people of the inequalities that still exists to counteract the Obama’s effect.
关键词是：remind people of the inequalities that still exists 提醒人们不平等仍然存在，persist与exist是近义词，都是存在的意思。与C选项对应，故此题答案为C。
8. According to Effron, if Hillary Clinton or Sarah Palin had been elected, there would also have been a negative effect on our views of women.
此题问的是如果Hillary Clinton 或Sarah Palin 当选，会有什么负面影响？
从文中也可以找到答案：
“There’s no reason we wouldn’t have seen the same effect on our views of women if Hillary Clinton or Sarah Palin had been elected,” says Effron. So the election of a female leader might have a downside for other women.
这里的the same effect 是指与奥巴马有同样的影响，即the negative effect.
关键词为：effect on our views of women ，故此题答案为：our views of women 

9. It is possible that the Obama effect will be short-lived if there is a change in people’s political sentiment.
此题问的是如果人们的什么改变的话，奥巴马热将会消失。
从文中此处可以找到答案：We also don’t yet know how long the Obama effect—both its good side and its bad—will last. Political sentiment is notoriously changeale: What if things begin to go wrong for Obama, and his popularity slumps?
关键词为：Political sentiment is notoriously changeale即政治态度的改变。后面又进一步解释说明。故此题答案为：political sentiment 

10. The worst possible aspect of the Obama effect is that people could ingore his race altogether and continue to hold on to their old racial sterotypes.
此题从文中最后一段可以找到答案：And what if Americans become so familiar with having Obama as their president that they stop considering his race altogether? “Over time he might become his own entity,” says Plant. This might seem like the ultimate defeat for racism, but ignoring the race of certain select individuals—a phenomenon that psychologists call subtyping—also has an insidious(隐伏的)side. “We think it happens to help people preserve their beliefs, so they can still hold on to the previous sterotypes.” That could turn out to be the cruellest of all the twists to the Obama effect.
关键词为： hold on to the previous sterotypes，
这里需要解释下sterotypes:刻板印象（sterotype）便是众人共同形成的人格化
而An ethnic stereotype is a generalized representation of an ethnic group, composed of what are thought to be typical characteristics of members of the group. Ethnic stereotypes are commonly portrayed in ethnic jokes.
ethnic是与racial同义的，故此题答案为：sterotypes.


听力解析
11. A) The man failed to keep his promise.
该题可用排除法得出答案。从对话中可知，男士忘了将女士的书带来，而女士的那本书是她从图书馆借来的。同时女士也明确表明周五晚上是最后期限，男士必须在此之前还她，因此答案是A，因为男士没有信守承诺，将书带给女士。
12. C) The woman should spend more time outdoors.
该题关键是弄懂医生说的那句话，因为女士一天到晚呆在室内接受人工光源的照射，于是身体无法自动调节时间，因此医生认为女士应该多出去走走，做一些户外活动。
13. D) It is not a good idea to buy the T-shirt.
该对话中，男士想要买那些T恤，但女士认为“你会后悔的。他们很贵，同时她还听说这种T恤洗的时候容易褪色”，因此女士明显是自己没买那件T恤，同时也不想让男士买那些T恤。
14. B) Most readers do not share his viewpoints.
对话中女士赞扬男士发表的文章非常好，论点很有说服力。男士的回答是，就读者总体反映来看，他们两个人绝对是出于少数人的行列，也就是说只有少数人认为赞同男士在文章中的论点。
15. A) Leave Daisy alone for the time being.
由女士说的“if I were you, I’d let her cool off a few days before I approach her”，因此，女士希望男士先让Daisy冷静几天，等怒气消停了再说。cool off意为“冷静，平静下来，息怒”。
16. A) Batteries.
男士刚开始便问“where I can get batteries…”，因此本文选A。
17. D) The man can get the ticket at its original price.
该对话中，男士没买到票，而女士则刚好有，她身体不舒服，故而想将自己的票以原价转让给男士，故选D。该文主要是由“You can have it for what it cost me”得出。
18. A) The speakers will dress formally for the concert.
对话中女士已表明，这是州交响乐团第一次到本市表演，因此必须要穿西装打领带，也就是着正装。
19. D) He is undecided as to which job to go for.
文中开始部分女士问“So you are not sure which to go for?”，男士回答的是“That’s it.”表明男士还没决定应该选哪份工作。
20. C) They are all adults.
由“The Polytechnic is all adults and mostly preparation for exams like the Cambridge certificates.”可得出。
21. B) Varied and interesting.
男士提及the Language School in Pistoia时说到教学类型很多时，女士回答的是“that sounds much more varied and interesting.”因此该题选B。
22. C) Hosting a television show.
Good evening and welcome to tonight's edition of Legendary Lives.
注意容易混淆的A选项。
23. A) He lost his mother.
男士提及“He wasn't there long though because his mother passed away just four years later. Jimmy's father sent him back to Indiana after that to live with his aunt.”
24. B) He got seriously into acting.
文中原句：then he went to college in California where he got seriously into acting
25. B) He has long been a legendary figure.
原文提到“So what made him the legend he still is today?” 说明从过去到现在James Dean一直是一个Legend。

仔细阅读解析
Section A
47 a grade above 94 / a higher grade
48 select the method of grading
49 improving
50 effort and accomplishment
51 discuss his concern
47 文中第一段告诉我们，这个九年级学生不满意艺术老师给出的94分，因为在前一学年中，他获得了一个99，一个100，他认为这个94不能反映出他花在这门课上的心血。因此，这个九年级同学认为他的老师应该给他一个比94更高的分数。题目中的should have given him指“本应该给他”，表示一种与事实相反的假设。
48 答案在Answer 部分的第一段第二句。原文中的deserve wide latitude与have the freedom 意义相近，promote learning 与encourage learning 表达的意思相同。因此答案是select the method of grading，指选择判分的方式。
49 答案在文章Answer 部分的第二段第二、三句。这一部分表达的意思是一个拿到了100分的学生仍会有很大的需要进步的空间。第二句中有一个词可以表达继续进步的意思，即improve. keep 后需接动词的ing形式，因此填入的词是improving.
50 Rembrandt （伦勃朗，17世纪一位荷兰画家，文章中提到的The Night Watch 是他的名作《夜巡》）出现在Answer 部分的第三段。伦勃朗的例子主要是为了说明付出与成就不完全对等。答案在这一段第二句中，应填入的内容是effort and accomplishment. 题目中的distinction, 意思是区别。
51 答案在文章最后一句，应填入的内容是discuss his concern.
Section B
Passage 1
52. A) America is now the only developed country without the policy.
由第一自然段最后一句“We’re now the only wealthy country without such a policy”可得出答案，答案A中developed其实就与wealthy的同义。
53. D) The opposition from business circles.
由文章第二自然段可看出，美国商会和其他商业团体常常对于美国关于平衡工作与家庭生活两者关系的法律均是百般阻挠，相反民主党领导人常常是支持这项法律的。
54. B) Good parenting benefits society.
Anne Alstott教授在其书中表达的主要观点就是“justifying parental support depends on defining the family as a social good that, in some sense, society must pay for.”也就是说应该将家庭视作一个为社会带来好处的事情，同时该段中后面也阐述了社会期望也需要家长们对他们的孩子付出关爱。因此，教授的主要观点可以概括为良好的教养能造福于社会。
55. B) They fail to provide enough support for parents.
由最后一段中“The state recognizes this in the large body of family laws that govern children’s welfare, yet parents receive little help in meeting the life-changing obligations society imposes.”尽管州政府意识到了养育孩子的重要性，但是仍然家长们接受的帮助少之又少，因此答案为B。
56. D) It is basically a social undertaking.
由文中最后一段“To classify parenting as a personal choice for which there is no collective responsibility is not merely to ignore the social benefits of good parenting…”可得出，将养育孩子作为一种个人选择，而不加之以社会责任的话，便是忽视良好教养所产生的社会效应……这里的collective responsibility指的就是一种社会责任，意指良好教养是一个需要全社会共同努力的事业，因为其带来的社会效应是巨大的。因此作者反对将养育孩子仅仅作为个人选择来看待。作者需要的是collective responsibility，因此答案选D，因为教养孩子是一种社会事业。该题是带概括性质的题。
Passage 2
57 A) More young voters are going to the polls than before.
本题问CIRCLE新的研究发现是什么，注意题目问的是CIRCLE的研究，文章第一句就说研究发现当今的年轻人比前几代年轻人更多地参与投票，因此选A项。注意B项是另一项研究的发现。
58 C) Whether young people will continue to support Osama’s policy.
本题问“Ｏ”代人作家主要关心的是什么。文章第二段中说道他们想要观察年轻人是否会继续支持奥巴马。因此此题选Ｃ项。
59 D) Their lives in relation to Osama’s presidency.
本题问“Ｏ”代人博客会写什么东西。文章第二段中说会记录美国人的生活，看新的总统和他的政府会如何影响人民的生活，也就是记录奥巴马政府怎样影响人民的生活，因此此题选Ｄ项。
60 C) Their utilization of the Internet.
本题问在Henry Flores看来，是什么原因造成年轻一代开始有一定的政治优势。文章最后一段告诉我们互联网使年轻人接触更多的思想，也使不同地区有着同样想法的人聚集起来，因此本题选C。
61 D) They are indifferent to politics.
本题问从本段话中我们可以推断出“X”代人有什么特征。文章最后一段的倒数第二句话说“boomer”摆脱了从他们父母身上继承的冷漠的（apathy）一面，由此可见“X”代人是冷漠的，因此本题选D。
完形填空解析
62.A)findings B)theses C)hypotheses D)abstracts
 　　
　　答案A 。解决该题首先应理解文章首句的句意“一项新的研究发现，在过去的两年中，邻居有更多绿地的那些城市里的儿童比那些住在钢筋混凝土中且附近没什么数目的儿童少增重13%。”该句在宾语从句的句首就充分说明了这是一个调查结果，因此在本题承接的Such这个标志也就说明要选入一个与调查结果相关的单词，故而选[A]。[A]意为调查结果，[B]意为主题，[C]意为臆测，[D]意为抽象。
 　　
　　63. A)adapt B)attribute C)allocate D)alternate
 　　
　　答案B。 该题前句意思是“肥胖的流行始于20世纪80年代”，后句的显性意思为“许多人___增加了食物的分量以及很少运动”。少运动，增加食物分量和肥胖之间产生的显然是因果关系，因此这里要选的是和有因果关系的单词，故而选[B]。[A]意为适应于，[B]意为归因于，[C]意为分配，[D]意为转变。
 　　
　　64. A)amongst B)along C)beside D)with
 　　
　　答案D。 原句意为“快餐和电视伴随着我们已经很长时间了。”该句和前面所提及的增加了食物的分量和缺少运动一一对应。
 　　
　　65. A)glued B)related C)tracked D)appointed
 　　
　　答案B。 承接上述所说的一一对应关系，因此该题则是对应前句的“but that can’t be everything.”因此可以推出，“许多专家认为改变与环境有关”的句意。因此该题选择related。[A]意为粘附，[B]意为相关，[C]意为追踪，[D]意为委任，委派。
 　　
　　66. A)scraping B)denying C)depressing D)shrinking
 　　
　　答案D。 该句以That引导说明与前句为并列关系，因此前句所说的与环境相关，这里亦可理解为与环境相关，因此这里要说明的是肥胖与绿色植物的减少有关。数量的减少只能用shrink。[A]意为拆毁，废弃，[B]意为否定，[C]意为萧条，沮丧，[D]意为收缩，缩小。
 　　
　　67. A)published B)simulated C)illuminated D)circulated
 　　
　　答案A 。该题明显考察动词作分词结构，后句是一本书的名字，因此此项新研究应当公布于书中，故而用published。[A]意为公布，[B]意为模仿，模拟，[C]意为照亮，[D]意为流通，循环。
 　　
　　68. A)at B)to C)for D)over
 　　
　　答案B。 此处考察固定搭配be closer to。提请同学们注意的是to在此处的作用是介词而不是不定式。
 　　
　　69. A)fully B)simply C)seriously D)uniquely
 　　
　　答案B。 原句意思是“最直接的表现就是一个有绿地的邻居__意味着给孩子们更多玩耍的空间。” [A]意为完全，充分，[B]意为坦白地，仅仅，[C]意为严肃地，严重地，[D]意为独特地。仅从句意难以判断，必须结合上文所述，“该项研究并不是第一个指出绿地与更好的健康之间的关系，但是它却着实让我们更进一步了解它们之间的关系如何产生和为什么产生。”当提及下句的时候，又出现了“最直接的说法”，意为将前句复杂的句意简单化理解。因此这里选择simply。
 　　
　　70. A)vital B)casual C)fatal D)subtle
 　　
　　答案A 。该题需要填入的是与strongest correlations相关的褒义形容词，根据词义可判断仅有vital符合。[A]意为重要的，[B]意为临时的，随意的，[C]意为致命的，[D]意为微妙的，敏感的。
 　　
　　71. A)still B)already C)too D)yet
 　　
　　答案C。 该句的选择需分析与后句的逻辑关系，前后两句均讨论绿色环境对思维的益处，因此该题选择并列结构的too。
 　　
　　72. A)benefits B)profits C)revenues D)awards
 　　
　　答案A 。既然是并列结构，前后的褒贬义需要一致，前句有good for词组作为支撑，后句则需要选择相应的褒义单词，根据词义只能选择benefit。[A]意为益处，[B]意为利润，[C]意为收入，[D]意为奖励。
 　　
　　73. A)outward B)apart C)aside D)outside
 　　
　　答案D 。既然是和绿色环境有关，则是暗示在外阅读，因此要选择在外面的单词outside而不能是向外的outward。
 　　
　　74. A)Immunity B)Reaction C)Exposure D)Addiction
 　　
　　答案C。 该句仍是承接上句的并列句型，既然前面提及在外阅读，这里则是暴露于草地。[A]意为免疫，[B]意为反映，[C]意为暴露，[D]意为沉溺于。
 　　
　　75. A)much B)less C)more D)little
 　　
　　答案B。 该句重点考察学生们是否理解并列结构的一致性。并列前后要求形容词的级别一致和褒贬义一致，更低的体重指数对应的并然是更少的压力，故而选less。
 　　
　　76. A)installment B)expedition C)analysis D)option
 　　
　　答案C。 对于3000名东京居民的__，显然是调查，与本文一直强调的research相互对应，因此该处选择与调查相关的analysis。[A]意为分期付款，[B]意为远征，[C]意为调查分析，[D]意为选择。
 　　
　　77. A)curiously B)negatively C)necessarily D)comfortably
 　　
　　答案C。 该题为本次六级完形填空题目中最难的题目。必须理解该句的逻辑关系再进行选择。“格拉斯提醒说大多数的研究并没有__证明绿地与健康之间的因果关系，但是他们却正在帮助刺激这种行为。”根据转折关系的定义确定后面所提为褒义，前句必然提及的是贬义，因此没有证明因果关系已经达到贬义效果，不应再修饰副词中再加入贬义单词，首先排除curiously和negatively。其次既然是没有证明，只能用necessarily，不能用comfortably。[A]意为好奇地，[B]意为负面地，[C]意为必要地，[D]意为舒服地，充分地。
 　　
　　78. A)relieved B)delegated C)approved D)performed
 　　
　　答案C。“美国众议院可喜地__名为禁止单独留下孩童法案。”既然与法案有关，只可是approve。[A]意为解除，减轻，[B]意为派代表，[C]意为批准，同意，[D]意为演奏。
 　　
　　79. A)merely B)always C)mainly D)almost
 　　
　　答案B。并列关系的又一次考察，后面说你不得不努力工作去为你的家人挣得一小片绿地和树林，因此前句必然说的是寻找绿地不容易。故而此处选择always。
 　　
　　80. A)advantages B)exception C)measure D)charge
 　　
　　答案A。 固定搭配take advantage of，好好利用某事/某物。[B]意为额外，[C]意为措施，[D]意为收费。

Short Conversation

11. M: Oh, I’m so sorry I forgot to bring along the book you borrowed from the library.

W: What a terrible memory you have! Anyway, I won’t need it until Friday night. As long as I can get it by then, OK?

Q: What do we learn from this conversation?

12. W: Doctor, I haven’t been able to get enough sleep lately, and I’m too tired to concentrate in class.

M: Well, you know, spending too much time indoors with all that artificial lighting can do that to you. Your body loses track of whether it’s day or night.

Q: What does the man imply?

13. M: I think I’ll get one of those new T-shirts, you know, with the school’s logo on both the front and the back.

W: You’ll regret it. They are expensive, and I’ve heard the printing fades easily when you wash them.

Q: What does the woman mean?

14. W: I think your article in the school newspaper is right on target, and your viewpoints have certainly convinced me.

M: Thanks, but in view of the general responses, you and I are definitely in the minority.

Q: What does the man mean?

15. M: Daisy was furious yesterday because I lost her notebook. Should I go see her and apologize to her again?

W: Well, if I were you, I’d let her cool off a few days before I approach her.

Q: What does the woman suggest the man do?

16. M: Would you please tell me where I can get batteries for this brand of camera?

W: Let me have a look. Oh, yes, go down this aisle, pass the garden tools, you’ll find them on the shelf next to the light bulbs.

Q: What is the man looking for?

17. M: Our basketball team is playing in the finals but I don’t have a ticket. I guess I’ll just watch it on TV. Do you want to come over?

W: Actually I have a ticket. But I’m not feeling well. You can have it for what it cost me.

Q: What do we learn from the conversation?

18. M: Honey, I’ll be going straight to the theatre from work this evening. Could you bring my suit and tie along?

W: Sure, it’s the first performance of the State Symphony Orchestra in our city, so suit and tie is a must.

Q: What do we learn from the conversation?

Long Conversations

Conversation 1

M: I got two letters this morning with job offers, one from the Polytechnic, and the other from the Language School in Pistoia, Italy.

W: So you are not sure which to go for?

M: That’s it. Of course, the conditions of work are very different: The Polytechnic is offering two-year contract which could be renewed, but the Language School is only offering a year’s contract, and that’s a definite minus. It could be renewed, but you never know.

W: I see. So it’s much less secure. But you don’t need to think too much about steady jobs when you are only 23.

M: That’s true.

W: What about the salaries?

M: Well, the Pistoia job pays much better in the short term. I’ll be getting the equivalent of about 22,000 pounds a year there, but only 20,000 pounds at the Polytechnic. But then the hours are different. At the Polytechnic I’d have to do 35 hours a week, 20 teaching and 15 administration, whereas the Pistoia school is only asking for 30 hours teaching.

W: Mmm…

M: Then the type of teaching is so different. The Polytechnic is all adults and mostly preparation for exams like the Cambridge certificates. The Language School wants me to do a bit of exam preparation, but also quite a lot of work in companies and factories, and a couple of children’s classes. Oh, and a bit of literature teaching.

W: Well, that sounds much more varied and interesting. And I’d imagine you’d be doing quite a lot of teaching outside the school, and moving around quite a bit.

M: Yes, whereas with the Polytechnic position, I’d be stuck in the school all day.

Questions 19 to 21 are based on the conversation you have just heard:

Q19. What do we learn about the man from the conversation?

Conversation 2

Good evening and welcome to tonight's edition of Legendary Lives. Our subject this evening is James Dean, actor and hero for the young people of his time. Edward Murray is the author of a new biography of Dean.

W: Good evening, Edward.

M: Hello Tina.

W: Edward, tell us what you know about Dean's early life.

M: He was born in Indiana in 1931, but his parents moved to California when he was five. He wasn't there long though because his mother passed away just four years later. Jimmy's father sent him back to Indiana after that to live with his aunt.

W: So how did he get into acting?

M: Well, first he acted in plays at high school, then he went to college in California where he got seriously into acting. In 1951 he moved to New York to do more stage acting.

W: Then when did his movie career really start?

M: 1955. His first starring role was in East of Eden. It was fabulous. Dean became a huge success. But the movie that really made him famous was his second one, Rebel Without a Cause, that was about teenagers who felt like they didn't fit into society.

W: So how many more movies did he make?

M: Just one more, then he died in that car crash in California in 1955.

W: What a tragedy! He only made three movies! So what made him the legend he still is today?

M: Well I guess his looks, his acting ability, his short life, and maybe the type of character he played in his movies. Many young people saw him as a symbol of American youths.

Section B

Passage 1

The time is 9 o’clock and this is Marian Snow with the news.

The German authorities are sending investigators to discover the cause of the plane crash late yesterday on the island of Tenerife. The plane, a Boeing 737, taking German holiday makers to the island crashed into a hillside as it circled while preparing to land. The plane was carrying 180 passengers. It’s thought there are no survivors. Rescue workers are at the scene.

The British industrialist James Louis, held by kidnappers in Central Africa for the past 8 months, was released unharmed yesterday. The kidnappers had been demanding 1 million pounds for the release of Mr. Louis. The London Bank and their agents who had been negotiating with the kidnappers have not said whether any amount of money has been paid.

The 500 UK motors workers who had been on strike in High Town for the past 3 three weeks went back to work this morning. This follows successful talks between management and union representatives, which resulted in a new agreement on working hour and conditions. A spokesman for the management said that they’d hope they could now get back to producing cars, and that they lost a lot of money and orders over this dispute.

And finally the weather. After a cold start, most of the country should be warm and sunny. But towards late afternoon, rain will spread from Scotland to cover most parts by midnight.

Passage 2

Juan Louis, a junior geology major, decided to give an informative speech about how earthquakes occur. From his audience analysis he learned that only 2 or 3 of his classmates knew much of anything about geology. Juan realized then that he must present his speech at an elementary level and with a minimum of scientific language.

As he prepared the speech, Juan kept asking himself, “How can I make this clear and meaningful to someone who knows nothing about earthquakes or geological principles?” Since he was speaking in the Midwest, he decided to begin by noting that the most severe earthquake in American history took place not in California or Alaska but at New Madrid, Missouri in 1811. If such an earthquake happened today, it would be felt from the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean and would flatten most of the cities in the Mississippi valley. That, he figured, should get his classmates’ attention.

Throughout the body of the speech, Juan dealt only with the basic mechanics of earthquakes and carefully avoided technical terms. He also prepared visual aids, diagramming fold lines, so his classmates wouldn’t get confused. To be absolutely safe, Juan asked his roommate, who was not a geology major, to listen to the speech. “Stop me,” he said, “any time I say something you don’t understand.” Juan’s roommate stopped him four times. And at each spot, Juan worked out a way to make his point more clearly. Finally, he had a speech that was interesting and perfectly understandable to his audience.

Questions 30 – 32 are based on the passage you have just heard.

Q30 What did Juan Louis learn from the analysis of his audience?

Q31 How did Juan Louis start his speech?

Q32 What did Juan ask his roommate to do when he was making his trial speech?

Passage 3

Esperanto is an artificial language, designed to serve internationally as an auxiliary means of communication among speakers of different languages. It was created by Ludwig Lazar Zamenhof, a Polish Jewish doctor specialized in eye diseases. Esperanto was first presented in 1887. An international movement was launched to promote its use. Despite arguments and disagreements, the movement has continued to flourish and has members in more than 80 countries.

Esperanto is used internationally across language boundaries by at least 1 million people, particularly in specialized fields. It is used in personal contexts, on radio broadcasts and in a number of publications as well as in translations of both modern works and classics. Its popularity has spread form Europe, both east and west, to such countries as Brazil and Japan. It is, however, in China that Esperanto has had its greatest impact. It is taught in universities and used in many translations, often in scientific or technological works. EL POPOLA CHINIO, which means “From People’s China”, is a monthly magazine in Esperanto and is read worldwide. Radio Beijing’s Esperanto program is the most popular program in Esperanto in the world.

Esperanto’s vocabulary is drawn primarily from Latin, the Romance languages, English and German. Spelling is completely regular. A simple and consistent set of endings indicates grammatical functions of words. Thus for example, every noun ends in “o”, every adjective in “a”, and the basic form of every verb in “i”. Esperanto also has a highly productive system of constructing new words from old ones.

Questions 33 – 35 are based on the passage you have just heard.

Q33 What does the speaker tell us about Esperanto?

Q34 What is said about the international movement to promote the use of Esperanto?

Q35 What does the speaker say about Esperanto in China?


Section C

George Herbert Mead said that humans are "talked into" humanity. He meant that we gain personal identity as we communicate with others. In the earliest years of our lives, our parents tell us who we are. "You're intelligent." "You're so strong." We first see ourselves through the eyes of others. So their messages form important foundations of our self-concepts. Later, we interact with teachers, friends, romantic partners and co-workers who communicate their views of us. Thus, how we see ourselves reflects the views of us that others communicate.

The profound connection between identity and communication is dramatically evident in children who are deprived of human contact. Case studies of children who are isolated from others reveal that they lack a firm self-concept, and their mental and psychological development is severely hindered by lack of language.

Communication with others not only affects our sense of identity, but also directly influences our physical and emotional well-being. Consistently, research shows that communicating with others promotes health, whereas social isolation is linked to stress, disease, and early death. People who lack close friends have greater levels of anxiety and depression than people who are close to others. A group of researchers reveal scores of studies that trace the relationship between health and interaction with others. The conclusion was that social isolation is statistically as dangerous as high blood pressure, smoking and obesity. Many doctors and researchers believe that loneliness harms the immune system, making us more vulnerable to a range of miner and major illnesses.
